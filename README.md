# TidyTuesday in Python

![png](file:///home/waiyan/Downloads/newplot%20(1).png)



   This project is inspired by [David Robinson's Tidy Tuesday live Screencast](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeiiqmVK07qhY-wvg3IZiZQ) on Youtube. I have been teaching Python myself doing  projects.
   After I have watched David's "Analyzing Art Collections with R" screen cast, I decided to share fellow Pythonistas that we could create beautiful plots in Python using Plotly/Seaborn/Plotnine, we could explore data using Pandas, we could do machine learning models using scikit learn , Tensorflow. I am planning to share translated analyses as much as I can for anyone who's interested to translate R code to Python for improving Python like me.
   Thanks David for such great screen casts. Idea credits goes to David. If there is something wrong with my projects , it would be me who still need to improve ideas and assumptions on datasets.
   The dataset comes from the [Tidy Tuesday project](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)
